    /* Every HTML data in any website is surrounded within a box */

   PADDING --- Control the space b/w border n text it is used..
   (left,right,top,bottom) 

   MARGIN --- space b/w webpage/ browser and border
    
    /*MARGIN COLLAPSING*/
     When two margins are coming together at that time the one with highest pixel will be considered..
   

      /** POSITION PROPERTIES**/
      5 PROPERTIES -- Whenever we use any of the position properties we can control left, right,top, bottom.
      
      1. STATIC --useless
      2. RELATIVE -- The movement of left,right,top,bottom will always happen from its 
                     ORIGINAL POSITION
      3. ABSOLUTE --  The movement of left,right,top,bottom will always happen from the
                      WEBPAGE/BROWSER     


     *** If we use only absolute position without relative position, that absolute will take
         its position always from the webpage. 

         If we use absolute( child )  and relative (parent, grandparent,...) together that
         absolute will take  its position always from the parent which is made relative..

        ****** PSEUDO CLASSES****
         They are used to define some special status to our html data.
         Reprensted by :
         pseudo(greek word) meaning: false or not genuine
        All the pseudo classes like :hover,:visited,..... are not the inbuilt classes which 
        are presnt in HTML language..

        a:hover---- /*exactly work at the time of keeping cursor on that link*/
        a:active----  /*exactly at the time of clicking*/
        a:visited---- /*once the link is clicked and visisted*/
        a:link---- 

       /* h1:nth child(){ color} concept */ n=0,1,2,....
       /* h1:nth child(2n+3){}--valid*/
        /* h1:nth child(2n+n){}-- not valid*/
         /* h1:nth child(2+3n){}-- not valid*/

    *div tag will be applied only if the child is div only. it is not applicable ig child is span*
     similar to span tag also.
