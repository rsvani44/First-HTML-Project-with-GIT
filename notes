    /* Every HTML data in any website is surrounded within a box */

   PADDING --- Control the space b/w border n text it is used..
   (left,right,top,bottom) 

   MARGIN --- space b/w webpage/ browser and border
    
    /*MARGIN COLLAPSING*/
     When two margins are coming together at that time the one with highest pixel will be considered..
   

      /** POSITION PROPERTIES**/
      5 PROPERTIES -- Whenever we use any of the position properties we can control left, right,top, bottom.
      
      1. STATIC --useless
      2. RELATIVE -- The movement of left,right,top,bottom will always happen from its 
                     ORIGINAL POSITION
      3. ABSOLUTE --  The movement of left,right,top,bottom will always happen from the
                      WEBPAGE/BROWSER     


     *** If we use only absolute position without relative position, that absolute will take
         its position always from the webpage. 

         If we use absolute( child )  and relative (parent, grandparent,...) together that
         absolute will take  its position always from the parent which is made relative..
